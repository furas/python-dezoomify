# python-dezoomify

It is NOT fork of [dezoomify on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dezoomify/) (nor [dezoomify on GitHub](https://github.com/valgur/dezoomify) nor [dezoomify-py on GitHub](https://github.com/lovasoa/dezoomify-py)) which work only with `zoomify`. All use the same code.

It is code which someone made in 2014/2015 for one map in `zoomify` and I helped to modify it.

In 2019 I made script for maps in `krpano`.
