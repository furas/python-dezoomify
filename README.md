# python-dezoomify

It is **NOT** fork of [dezoomify from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dezoomify/)
(nor [valgur/dezoomify](https://github.com/valgur/dezoomify) nor [lovasoa/dezoomify-py](https://github.com/lovasoa/dezoomify-py) from GitHub). All of them use the same code and work only with `zoomify` maps.

---

It is code which someone made in 2014/2015 for one `zoomify` map (pobieracz_mapy_wroc.py) and I helped to modify it (I don't remeber).

In 2019 I made script for `krpano` maps.
